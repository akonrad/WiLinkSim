 BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal." BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.
 BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in adveres and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal."

irst place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal." BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained ge to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal." BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us,Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watwins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort th, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal." BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal."

irst place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal." BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal."
 BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.

They have agreed a compromise of 17 days and Ganguly said: "We definitely always wanted to play.

"It had to be a give and take policy, we have existing contracts and of course breaking them is illegal." BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

Moenchengladbach deepened Berlin's crisis as Markus Muench scored in the 9th and Joris van Hout in the 58th minute. Veteran forward Michael Preetz notched a goal in the 80th for Berlin.

Berlin coach Huub Stevens was brought to the German capital to finally give last year's Bundesliga fourth-place club a title after winning the UEFA Cup and two German Cups with Schalke. But the team has reeled to a 0-3-1 record and is now under pressure.

"There's good times and bad times and now I need support for the players -- its going to very hard for us," Stevens said.

Nasser Hussain believes he has never led an England side in ruder health than the one he takes down under this winter.

Immediately after the drawn Test series with India, which was inevitable before rain washed out the final day of the Oval Test, England captain Hussain turned his thoughts to the Ashes.

It has never been far from his thoughts this week, despite his own suggestions to the contrary pre-match, as he has had continuous discussions over who will be on the plane to Australia in five weeks.

Most of the talk has been on the fitness and availability of several key players, including fast bowler Darren Gough and leading batsman Graham Thorpe, and how to fill the Adelaide-based Academy ahead of the announcement of an expected 17-man party at Lord's.

The last time Hussain led England against the Aussies, last summer, they entered the series on the back of wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka the previous summer.

This year England are unbeaten but have failed to hold leads in series with New Zealand and India.

However, Hussain said: "It's the most positive England side I have captained going into an Ashes series, as long as we can get our bowling attack fit and raring to go.

"If we do that and take our catches with the way our batters are playing at the moment we have a very good chance.

"I think our players have moved on a bit, Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick opening the batting, our playing of spin has moved on, Mark Butcher is now a regular, we have seen we have pace available and we just need to get them fit and playing.

"And we have a much larger squad of players to select from whereas last year if we had one or two injuries we were up against it.

"We are in much more confident mood but they are obviously the best side in the world, they have hammered South Africa, they have hammered everyone.

"Give them the credit they deserve but at the same time say 'England are playing good cricket why not go over there and put on a good performance?"'

Hussain has called for his side to play 'positively and aggressively' against Australia, and in doing so combat nemesis Shane Warne.

Leg-spinner Warne has 118 Ashes wickets in 23 Tests but Vaughan, who was named England's man of the series, and the rest of the England top order have stood up to Indian duo Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh and prospered.

"To have faced them won't have done any harm, we have to cope with his (Warne's) aggression as well but we have improved the basics of playing spin thanks to our coach Duncan Fletcher," said Hussain.

"I saw something I thought I would never see in my captaincy today during the rain break when Rahul Dravid went up to Michael Vaughan and said 'how did you play (Muttiah) Muralitharan?'

"That's a first for me, an Asian lad asking Vaughan how to play spin.

"If we are going to be successful in Australia we will have to put an end to one or two of our hoodoos and that includes Warne."

Hussain has little time to reflect on this 1-1 draw before flying out to the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on Thursday.

He insists England have played well to compete with a highly-talented Indian team and said after the fourth Test draw: "I think the batting was exceptional again, we played spin well, we were much more disciplined with the ball, we held our catches and it was a good performance all round."

Opposing captain Sourav Ganguly was in no doubt, however, as to who have been the better side during a 10-month spell of 10 one-day internationals and seven Tests between them.

"We won the Test series in India, drew the one-day series in India, won the one-day series here and drew the Test series here so I think that will sum up who was the best side," said Ganguly.

He admits England have a chance this winter but his own side may have shocked Hussain's men had they not been shot out for 221 at Lord's in the first Test defeat.

Dravid, man of the match at The Oval and India's man of the series, then batted for the equivalent of an entire Test in the next three and a half as India finished in the ascendancy in their quest for a first series win outside Asia for 16 years.

"From the second innings at Lord's we started to play well, we did not bat well there in the first innings but since we have scored 450 every time," said Ganguly.

Hussain will be given one of the first batch of central contracts this week and urged the England and Wales Cricket Board to sign up Zimbabwean coach Fletcher on a long-term deal to encourage future success.

"We have to take the next step, if we can, from being a competitive side to one that wins more games," said Hussain.

"I hope the ECB extend Duncan Fletcher's contract because he is the singular reason why we are more successful.

"They should sort that out immediately because he is the finest coach I have played under."

Hussain will face the country of his birth in Sri Lanka next week after the Indians agreed a compromise over their conflict of interest in signing sponsorship terms for the tournament.

Part of the agreement they were requested to sign meant that they could not appear in advertisements for competitors to tournament sponsors during the event and for 30 days after it.
 BERLIN (AP) -- Bayern Munich gave Franz Beckenbauer an early birthday gift Tuesday by grabbing a share of first place in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-1 victory against crosstown rival 1860 Munich.

Bayern pulled even in the table with surprising VfL Bochum, which frustrated Borussia Dortmund and ended with a 0-0 home victory against the defending champions. Both sides are 3-0-1 with a 12-3 goal difference.

French international Johan Micoud also made a sensational debut for Werder Bremen, scoring a goal and taking complete charge of the attack as Werder Bremen routed FC Nuremberg 4-1.

The Bavarians again lived up to the preseason hype of how good they are with the addition of Michael Ballack as they overcame a 14th minute goal by 1860's Martin Max -- then ripped their city rival with one scoring chance after another.

Beckenbauer, the club president, turned 57 on Wednesday. That came just two hours after watching his team win for the 101st time in the 196th derby between the two clubs in front of 69,000.

"We're getting better from match to match, but what wasn't good was how many scoring chances we wasted," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.

After 1860 'keeper Simon Jetzsch needed some spectacular saves just to keep the Bayern in check, Hasan Salihamidzic finally leveled the match in the 40th.

Forward Claudio Pizarro then side-footed a Ze Roberto cross inside the left post in the 53rd minute and Giovane Elber followed in the 76th minute, rifling a shot inside the right post after a collision between two players dropped the loose ball in his path.

Dortmund dominated the first half against Bochum, showing some fine attacking soccer, with the best chance coming in the 28th minute when Thorsten Frings' header cracked off the left post. After the break, however, Bochum had the better chances with its counterattacking style which had produced 12 goals.

The draw left Dortmund 1-3-1 and stuck in the middle of the pack.

"I have a feeling we want to be good, but we're missing something," Dortmund coach Matthias Sammer said. "We're not ice skaters, you don't get points for artistic merit."

In the day's other match, Moenchengladbach handed Hertha Berlin its first defeat at Olympiastadion in 13 months, using its stingy defense to win 2-1. Five more fourth round matches are on tap for Wednesday.

Brazilian forward Ailton scored a hat trick for Bremen, but it was Micoud who took charge in the victory just a few days after joining the Bundesliga team from AC Parma.

The French national team player, running the attack like he was a Bremen veteran, scored his team's go-ahead goal in the 59th minute, taking a through pass near the cage and blasting a rising shot inside the right post. He also had one score from the spot called back and the follow-up attempt crack off the post.

"With Micoud, we now have a player who knows what he has to do out there," said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf.

Sasa Ciric had Nuremberg's goal, while Ailton used a couple of solo runs to score in the 30th, 66th and 79th minutes.
